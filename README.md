# groundhog_day_targets

In this folder, R scripts follow the targets workflow.

I need to re-write the old scripts, which are in the `groundhogday` folder (written for Snakemake), so that they can be used with the targets workflow.

I still have to add a new target, which is already written in the intprogress.R file.
